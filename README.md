# Super Loops 🎢
This is a repository dedicated to our in-progress game Super Loops.  

Super Loops is a puzzle game presented in a 2D side perspective. The player will be responsible for placing rails down to successfully facilitate a rollercoaster and its occupant, winning if you get the coaster to the other end of the screen. This is easier said than done, however, because of the game’s introduction of an immovable portion of the track (loops) that serve as creative obstacles for the player to overcome. By creating certain “quotas” the player has to fulfill in order to complete a certain level, it creates a funnel for emergent gameplay and unique solutions.
